## Introduction to GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for APIs, as well as a server-side runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data. It was developed by Facebook in 2012 and released as an open-source project in 2015. GraphQL offers a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to traditional REST APIs.
